# User guide

The guide for user installing and configuring the application.

[See daobs overview description](../README.md).


## Harvesting catalogs

Daobs support harvesting from [OGC CSW](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat) services.
The application support ISO19139 and ISO19115-3 standards.


Sign in and move to the harvesting section. 
Click on ```+``` button to add a new one.


![Add an harvester]

Click on ```harvest``` button to start harvesting the catalog. During harvesting
the number of records will increase progressively. Harvesting is a background task
that user can follow in the ```monitoring``` tab.

Once all records are harvested, analysis tasks may be triggered depending on the 
server configuration. By default, the following tasks are triggered:

* [XSD and INSPIRE validation](../tasks/validation-checker/README.md)
* [Service/dataset links](../tasks/service-dataset-indexer/README.md)

[ETF validation](../tasks/etf-validation-checker/README.md)can manually be triggered.

Other tasks are also available:

* [Database validation](../tasks/db-validation-checker/README.md)
* [Associated resource indexer (experimental)](../tasks/data-indexer/README.md)


## Following background tasks progress

A minimal monitoring console allows to check if any background tasks (harvesting or analysis)
are running.

For the time being, no options are available to stop a background process.


## Creating reports

Once metadata records are harvested, user can create reports from the
```Monitoring``` > ```Create monitoring```. A report is composed of
a set of indicators and each indicator are based on query or expression.

By default, 2 reports are available:

![Default reports]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-reports.png)

User can preview report rules by clicking ```View report rules``` button:

![Report rules]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-preview.png)


First select a report, then:
* Choose a reporting area (ie. one harvester)
* (Optional) Use facets or query filter to subset records
* Click on ```Preview``` to compute indicators for this report


![Report indicator preview]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-preview-indicator.png)


Report preview allows to quickly filter indicators:
* Search by name or id
* ```Indicator with errors only```
* ```Indicator with non null value```


![Report indicator filter]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-preview-filter.png)

A report allows to save indicator values for a certain date. User can follow
the trend of indicators by generating reports on a regular basis. For example,
for INSPIRE, Member States provide report every year since 2011.


## Downloading reports

Reports can be download in various formats proposed in the ```Download``` dropdown button:

![Report download]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-download.png)


For INSPIRE format, it may be relevant to set contact details to populate
report metadata which will be required to create a full reporting:

![Report metadata]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-metadata.png)


## Submitting report

Report in INSPIRE format can be upload to the system from 
```Monitoring``` > ```Submit monitoring``` in order to build
dashboard from indicator values.


![Submit new report]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/monitoring-report-submit.png)



While uploading, import status is reported after each file processing.

## Managing report

When reports are uploaded, user can manage them from 
```Monitoring``` > ```Monitoring summary```.

## Analyzing using dashboards

### Default dashboards

By default, the application provides a set of dashboards for:

* INSPIRE (to follow INSPIRE monitoring)
* Metadata records (to analyze catalog content)


![Default dashboards]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/daobs/1.0.x/doc/img/dashboard-default.png)

Access the dashboard page, click load and choose dashboard configuration from the list
if default dashboard are not available. 

Default dashboard are available here ```dashboard/src/app/dashboards```.

By default no dashboard are loaded.

User can load a set of dashboards using the ```/daobs/samples/dashboard``` API.

Eg. http://localhost:8983/daobs/samples/dashboard/INSPIRE.json will load all INSPIRE specific dashboards.



### Creating your own dashboard

Sign in first. Then use the dashboard creation page to create new one using
the [Banana application](https://github.com/lucidworks/banana/wiki/Tutorials)


#### Index fields

Dashboards are based on index fields. It is usefull to well know the content of
the index to easily build new dashboard.

3 types of documents are available in the index.

* metadata
* indicators
* monitoringMetadata (ie. raw data)

Main fields for metadata document are the following:

* ```documentType```: Fixed value ```metadata```
* ```metadataIdentifier```: Metadata UUID
