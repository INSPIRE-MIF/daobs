## Getting Familiar with the Code in the Repository

Look for `README.md` files! Several directories contain a `readme.md` file that explains the contents of the directory and how to work with them.

### Configure your editor

If possible, configure your editor to follow the coding conventions of the
library.  A `.editorconfig` file is included at the root of the repository that
can be used to configure whitespace and charset handling in your editor.  See
that file for a description of the conventions.  The [EditorConfig](
http://editorconfig.org/#download) site links to plugins for various editors.
